# What's included in this repo?

## 1. read_write_formats:
   This cheatsheet includes syntax for spark to read and write files of different formats. Except SAS and CSV, others were summarized 
   while I was preparing CCA175 Spark and Hadoop developer exam in April 2019, they were all run through. 
   There might be enhancements later on to better support those functionalities.

## 2. spark_sql_functions:
   This cheatsheet includes commonly used spark sql functions, they were summarized in April 2019, they were run through then.
   This isn't intended to be an exhaustive list, but I will keep adding to the list as I use more.
